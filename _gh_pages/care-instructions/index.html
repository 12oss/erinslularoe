			<h1>LuLaRoe Care Instructions</h1>

			<p>You've recently purchased some LuLaRoe clothing and it is now time to wash your buttery soft patterns, but holy moly, you didn't even consider how you should care for it. No fear LuLaRoe-ligans, we've got you covered below.</p>

						<img data-original="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/insta-015.jpg" width="100%" alt="How to Care & Wash Your LuLaRoe Clothing." width="100%" class="thumb lazyload" style="padding: 15px 25px 25px 0px" />

					<p>To keep your LuLaRoe soft/vibrant and to prevent any type of shrinking just do the folowing:</p>
					<ol><strong>
						<li> Turn LuLaRoe garment inside out</li>
						<li> Wash in cold water on gentle cycle</li>
						<li> Lay flat to dry <small><em>(indoors)</em></small></li>
					</strong>
					</ol>
					<p>As with any article of clothing, your LuLaRoe clothing (over time and many, many washes) will age over time. No matter the brand this will happen. Washing clothing puts stress on the colors and texture - so the more you wash your LuLaRoe, the faster it will age.</p>

				<p>Additional care instructions can be found on the tags of certain LuLaRoe styles. But the best rule of thumb is:</p>
				<ol><strong>
						<li> Inside out</li>
						<li> Cold &amp; Gentle</li>
						<li> Air Dry</li>
					</strong>
				</ol>
