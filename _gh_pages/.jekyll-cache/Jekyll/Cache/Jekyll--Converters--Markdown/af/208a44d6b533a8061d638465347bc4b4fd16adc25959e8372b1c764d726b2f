I"‡<p>LuLaRoeâ€™s Irma Tunic is a loose, knit â€œhigh-lowâ€ tunic with fitted mid-length sleeves. Tunic tops are a major throw back to days gone by. And by days we actually mean centuries. The tunic is a shirt or gown that was worn by women starting in the days of ancient Greece and Rome. But itâ€™s not an ancient fashion, no maâ€™am. The tunic is such a simple design that is has withstood the test of (a looooong) time. Itâ€™s versatile and simple, and at LuLaRoe weâ€™ve found that those are the best styles because you can wear them however you want with just about anything you want and each design is going to be flattering and stylish.</p>
