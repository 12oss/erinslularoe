title: "XXS Jaxon Jacket 101 (Back)"

excerpt: "In another take on a fashion classic, the LuLaRoe Jaxon denim jacket runs a bit longer, falling about hip length, and is a bit more tailored to flatter bodies of all shapes and sizes. It features custom, buttery soft denim and twill fabrics that include spandex allowing for free and easy movement. The Jaxon has front pockets, and comes in multiple color-ways, shades, and washes with a limited number of them boasting unique embroidery. The ultimate in comfort and on trend fashion, the Jaxon jacket adds another element of style and utility to your favorite outfits."
