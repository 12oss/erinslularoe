title: "S Monroe Top 311"

excerpt: "The Monroe kimono is flowing, oversized and comfortable, and it comes in the prettiest patterned chiffon and lace fabrics. For added interest, the half-inch hem boasts a four-inch, cut-fringe embellishment giving it an almost flirty or sassy edge. It is great for throwing on over the most basic of outfits to look instantly polished and stylish. Looking and feeling great truly does not get easier than the Monroe kimono."
